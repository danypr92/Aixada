# Uncomment the line containing the FINAL variable to indicate that
# you will be building a production version.
#
# One consequence of this is that you will get real minified .js files.
# If the line is commented, files with the extension .min.js are still created,
# but they are really only concatenated javascript files. This still
# gives some efficiency gain in the browser because only one file has to be 
# downloaded.
#
# The next nontrivial line is the one you should uncomment:
#
#export FINAL = true
